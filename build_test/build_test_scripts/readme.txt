These scripts are used for dev and test.
There is no guarantee that any given one will work for you.

I've done my best make them environment agnostic, but I've learned the hard way that any assumption will fail
somewhere (e.g. macos)

That said, until I move to using pytest, these scripts act as the framework from which I build and test changes.
